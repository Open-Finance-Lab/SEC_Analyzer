A drop by 2.2% in a year.", "model_answer": "reasoning: \n- Operating margin indicates how much profit a company generates from operations per dollar of revenue. Adobe reports both GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin.\n- For Adobe, the trend through FY2022 shows: \n  - GAAP operating margin improved from 2020 to 2021, then ticked down in 2022 due to higher investment, FX headwinds, and acquisition-related/stock-based compensation effects.\n  - Non-GAAP operating margin has been in the mid-40% range for several years and was slightly lower in FY2022 than in FY2021, i.e., essentially stable to modestly compressed rather than improving.\n- Operating margin is a meaningful metric for a mature software/subscription company like Adobe because high gross margins allow operating leverage to show up clearly in operating income. However, GAAP operating margin can be distorted by stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses; many investors also consider non-GAAP operating margin and free cash flow margin alongside revenue growth.\n\nfinal_answer: \nNo. As of FY2022, Adobe’s operating margin profile was broadly stable to slightly down versus FY2021 on both GAAP and non-GAAP bases, so it was not improving. Operating margin is still a useful metric for Adobe, but it should be interpreted alongside non-GAAP adjustments and free cash flow margin due to the impact of stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses on GAAP results."}

As of the close of Q2 FY2023 (quarter ended Dec 31, 2022), Amcor reported a restructuring liability that primarily represents cash obligations for employee severance and benefits, site closure and consolidation costs, and contract/lease exit costs.

If gross margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then state that and explain why.", "gold_answer": "No. For AMCOR there has been a slight decline in gross margins by 0.8%.", "model_answer": "reasoning: \n- Amcor is a packaging converter that typically passes raw-material cost changes (resin, aluminum, paper) through to customers via price adjustments. This mechanically inflates or deflates reported sales while leaving dollar gross profit relatively unchanged, making gross margin percentage volatile and often inversely correlated with commodity prices.\n- Because of this pass-through model, gross margin percentage is not a reliable indicator of underlying profitability for Amcor. Management and investors typically focus on adjusted EBIT/EBITDA margin, free cash flow, and ROIC to assess performance.\n- As of FY2023, movements in gross margin were largely a function of raw-material price swings and timing of pass-throughs, along with volume/mix softness. These do not signify a structurally improving margin profile. Underlying profitability (e.g., adjusted EBIT margin) was generally flat to slightly softer rather than demonstrably improving.\n\nfinal_answer: Gross margin is not a useful metric for Amcor because its revenue includes significant raw‑material pass‑through that distorts the gross margin percentage without reflecting underlying economics. Use adjusted EBIT/EBITDA margin, free cash flow, and ROIC instead. On that basis, there is no clear evidence of an “improving” gross margin profile as of FY2023; underlying margin performance was roughly flat to slightly down despite gross margin percentage movements driven by commodity pass‑through and mix."}

Best Buy’s reported gross margin has generally sat in the low-20% range over the past decade, with year-over-year moves usually within about 0.5–1.5 percentage points. Occasional shifts can occur due to mix (higher-margin services/warranties vs. lower-margin hardware), vendor funding, and promotional intensity, but swings greater than roughly 2 percentage points in a single year are uncommon. For a large electronics retailer, gross margin is a relevant metric because it reflects merchandising/pricing discipline, attachment of services (e.g., warranties, Geek Squad), and the competitive promo environment.\n\nfinal_answer: Yes.

Boeing’s Commercial Airplanes segment is highly cyclical: airline demand for new jets rises and falls with global GDP, passenger traffic, airline profitability, fuel prices, and the availability/cost of financing. In downturns, airlines defer or cancel orders and Boeing adjusts production rates; in expansions, orders and deliveries ramp up. A large backlog and long delivery horizons provide some cushioning but don’t eliminate cyclicality. Boeing’s Defense, Space & Security is less tied to economic cycles and more to government budgets and geopolitical priorities, so it’s steadier but still subject to budget/program cycles. Global Services (aftermarket/MRO) is relatively more resilient due to recurring maintenance tied to flight hours, but it also dips when utilization drops (e.g., during COVID-19). Historically, Boeing has experienced pronounced cycles around 2001–2003, 2008–2009, and 2020–2021.\n\nfinal_answer: Yes. Boeing’s business—especially its commercial aircraft segment—is cyclical, with partial offsets from defense and services that reduce but do not eliminate overall cyclicality."}

As a diversified healthcare manufacturer (pharma, medtech, and in 2022 also consumer health), J&J maintains higher safety stocks, navigates regulated supply chains, temperature-controlled logistics, long production lead times, and product expirations—factors that naturally yield lower turnover than typical FMCG retailers.

If gross margins are not a relevant metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.", "gold_answer": "Since JPM is a financial institution, gross margin is not a relevant metric.", "model_answer": "reasoning:\n- JPMorgan Chase is a bank. Gross margin is defined as (revenue − cost of goods sold) ÷ revenue, a concept designed for product/service companies with COGS.\n- Banks do not have a conventional COGS; interest expense is part of core operations and is netted against interest income to form net interest income, while noninterest expense (compensation, tech, occupancy) is operating overhead, not COGS.\n- As a result, “gross margin” for banks is either undefined, near 100%, or depends on arbitrary “cost of revenue” classifications by data vendors, making it not meaningful or comparable over time.\n- To judge consistency/profitability for a bank, use bank-specific metrics such as net interest margin (NIM), the efficiency ratio (noninterest expense ÷ total revenue), pre-provision net revenue trends, ROE/ROTCE, and credit costs.\n\nfinal_answer:\nGross margin is not a relevant metric for JPMorgan Chase. Banks don’t have a true cost of goods sold, so any “gross margin” figure is not meaningful for consistency analysis.
