The company notes the percentage decline was “mainly from the impact on the calculation from the pass‑through of higher raw material costs during the current fiscal period and the impact of disposed operations.” (Consolidated Gross Profit)\n\nContext on metric usefulness:\n- For a packaging company like Amcor, gross margin percent can be a misleading standalone indicator because raw material price movements (resins, aluminum, paper, etc.) are often passed through to customers via contractual pricing mechanisms. When input costs rise, reported sales increase while gross profit dollars may change little, mechanically compressing the gross margin percentage. Amcor explicitly states: “Increases in the price of raw materials are generally able to be passed on to customers through contractual price mechanisms over time” and highlighted that higher pass‑throughs affected the gross margin calculation in FY2023.\n- Disposals (e.g., the sale of the Russian business) also affected mix and the margin calculation.\n\nBetter gauges of underlying performance for Amcor include Adjusted EBIT (and its margin), price/mix vs. volume trends, and cash flow.

If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then state that and explain why.", "gold_answer": "Performance is not measured through operating margin", "model_answer": "Short answer: “Operating margin” isn’t a very useful metric for American Express.\n\nWhy it’s not useful\n- Amex is a bank holding company and a payments/issuing business. For financial institutions, interest income/expense and credit loss provisions are core to operations, so the common “operating margin” used for industrial companies doesn’t map well.\n- Amex doesn’t present “operating income.” Instead, it reports total revenues net of interest expense, provisions for credit losses, and expenses. Investors typically look at:\n  - Efficiency ratio (expenses ÷ total revenues net of interest expense)\n  - Pre‑provision earnings (revenues net of interest expense minus expenses) and its margin\n  - Return on equity (ROE) and net interest yield\n\nWhat the closest proxies show in 2022\n- Pretax margin (pretax income ÷ total revenues net of interest expense) fell:\n  - 2022: $9,585m ÷ $52,862m ≈ 18%\n  - 2021: $10,689m ÷ $42,380m ≈ 25%\n- Efficiency ratio (lower is better) improved slightly:\n  - 2022: $41,095m ÷ $52,862m ≈ 77.8%\n  - 2021: $33,110m ÷ $42,380m ≈ 78.1%\n- Pre‑provision earnings margin rose a bit:\n  - 2022: ($52,862m – $41,095m) ÷ $52,862m ≈ 22.3%\n  - 2021: ($42,380m – $33,110m) ÷ $42,380m ≈ 21.9%\n\nContext from the filing\n- 2022 saw a large swing in provisions for credit losses (+$2.2bn in 2022 vs a release of $1.4bn in 2021), higher customer engagement costs (rewards/services) and compensation, and net losses in Amex Ventures, all of which pressured pretax margin, even as revenues grew 25%.\n\nBottom line\n- Because operating margin isn’t a meaningful metric for Amex, the better read is: pretax margin declined in 2022 versus 2021, while expense efficiency and pre‑provision earnings margin improved slightly."}

If gross margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.", "gold_answer": "Performance is not measured through gross margin", "model_answer": "Short answer: “Gross margin” isn’t a meaningful metric for American Express.\n\nWhy\n- As a bank holding company and integrated payments issuer/network, AXP doesn’t produce or sell physical goods, so it doesn’t report “cost of goods sold” or a gross margin line. Instead, its economics are driven by:\n  - fee revenues (e.g., discount revenue, net card fees, service fees),\n  - net interest income (interest on loans minus funding costs), and\n  - variable customer engagement costs (rewards, partner payments, Card Member services),\n  - provisions for credit losses, and operating expenses.\n\nWhat to look at instead (and what changed in FY2022)\n- Revenue strength (up 25% to $52.9B):\n  - Discount revenue up 25% on billed business +23% (travel rebound; T&E up 64%; average discount rate edged up to 2.34% from 2.30%).\n  - Net card fees up 17% on premium portfolio growth and record acquisitions.\n  - Net interest income up 28% on loan growth (+22% Card Member loans); net interest yield on loans was 10.6% vs 10.7% in 2021 (slight compression late in the year as rates rose).\n- Higher variable customer costs:\n  - Card Member rewards +27% (more spend in higher‑reward travel categories and more travel redemptions).\n  - Business development +31% (higher partner/client incentives with volume).\n  - Card Member services +48% (greater usage of travel-related benefits).\n- Credit costs swung unfavorable:\n  - Provision for credit losses moved from a $1.4B release in 2021 to a $2.2B build in 2022 (higher loans, higher delinquencies off very low levels, and macro updates).\n- Operating costs:\n  - Marketing +3% (still elevated to drive growth).\n  - Salaries/benefits +16% (headcount/comp).\n  - Other +35% (net losses in Amex Ventures vs gains in 2021).\n\nNet effect on profitability “margin”\n- Despite strong revenue growth, the combination of higher rewards/partner/service costs, the $3.6B year-over-year swing in credit provision, and higher operating costs reduced profitability:\n  - Pretax margin declined to ~18% (pretax income $9.6B / revenue $52.9B) from ~25% in 2021.\n  - Net income fell 7% to $7.5B.\n\nIf you need a margin proxy, use pretax or operating margin and the “spread”/yield metrics above, not gross margin."}

That pushes up current liabilities and can make working capital look negative by design.\n- Liquidity access: As of 12/31/2022, it had $1,495 million available on its $2.75 billion revolving credit facility (and $85 million cash), and $1,177 million of commercial paper outstanding; total available liquidity was about $1.58 billion.

JPM’s revenues are primarily net interest income (interest earned minus interest expense) plus fees, and expenses are reported as “noninterest expense.” The 10‑K presents “total net revenue,” “noninterest expense,” and “pre‑provision profit,” not “gross margin.”\n- What analysts use instead are bank-specific measures such as:\n  - Net interest margin/net yield on interest‑earning assets (e.g., 2.00% in 2022, 1.64% in 2021, 1.98% in 2020, on a managed basis)\n  - Efficiency/overhead ratio (noninterest expense ÷ total net revenue), which was 59% in 2022, 59% in 2021, and 56% in 2020\n  - Return on equity/assets, capital and liquidity ratios, etc.\n\nBecause “gross margin” isn’t defined or reported for banks and doesn’t map to their economics, assessing whether JPM’s “gross margins” fluctuate by ~2% per year isn’t meaningful. If you want a rough analog for operating efficiency consistency, JPM’s overhead ratio has been relatively stable (56–59% over 2020–2022), and its net yield moved with the rate cycle (1.64% → 2.00% from 2021 to 2022)."}

If the quick ratio is not relevant to measure liquidity, please state that and explain why.", "gold_answer": "No. The quick ratio was approximately 0.54 for Verizon. It indicated that Verizon does not have a healthy liquidity profile.", "model_answer": "Short answer: No. On a strict quick-ratio basis, Verizon’s FY2022 liquidity does not screen as “healthy.”\n\n- Quick assets (cash and cash equivalents + accounts receivable): $2,605m + $24,506m = $27,111m\n- Current liabilities: $50,171m\n- Quick ratio ≈ 27,111 / 50,171 ≈ 0.54x\n\nA ratio below 1.0 typically suggests limited coverage of near‑term obligations by the most liquid assets.\n\nHowever, the quick ratio is not very relevant for assessing Verizon’s liquidity. Reasons:\n- Business model and cash generation: Verizon produced $37.1 billion in operating cash flow in 2022, which is far more informative about liquidity than a point‑in‑time quick ratio for a large, subscription‑based, cash‑generative telecom.\n- Access to committed liquidity: Verizon had a $9.5 billion revolving credit facility undrawn and total unused capacity of $10.4 billion across credit lines at year‑end 2022, plus active access to the commercial paper and asset‑backed markets.\n- Composition of current liabilities: A meaningful portion is non‑cash or routinely refinanced/serviced (e.g., $6.6 billion of contract liabilities/deferred revenue that represent future service delivery, not cash outflow; current maturities of debt that are commonly rolled).\n- Industry norms: Capital‑intensive, investment‑grade telecoms often operate with quick ratios below 1.0 without liquidity stress due to recurring cash inflows and strong market access.\n\nConclusion: While the calculated quick ratio (~0.54x) is below the conventional “healthy” threshold, it is not a meaningful gauge of Verizon’s liquidity. Operating cash flow strength and ample committed/market liquidity indicate a solid liquidity profile despite the low quick ratio."}

This equals about 16.9% of operating revenues ($136.8 billion) and about 62% of cash from operations ($37.1 billion).\n- Very large asset base: gross PP&E of ~$308 billion and net PP&E of ~$107.4 billion; 77% of gross PP&E is network equipment.\n- High ongoing depreciation/amortization: $17.1 billion in 2022 (depreciation expense alone $14.6 billion), reflecting significant invested capital that must be replaced/maintained.\n- Spectrum is a major capital asset: wireless licenses on the balance sheet totaled ~$149.8 billion at year‑end; Verizon also paid another ~$3.7 billion for licenses/related items in 2022 and capitalized ~$1.7 billion of interest on spectrum under development.\n- Management’s own characterization: “2022 was a peak year of capital investment for us as we rapidly deployed C‑Band spectrum.”\n\nTogether, the scale of PP&E and spectrum, the double‑digit CapEx‑to‑revenue ratio, heavy depreciation, and significant cash outlays to build and maintain networks clearly indicate a capital‑intensive business."}
